## [PLAY HERE](https://jani-nykanen.itch.io/one-last-adventure)


**One Last Adventure** is a pixel-art metroidvania for web, created using standard web technologies including WebGL, WebAudio and whatever the gamepad API is known as. The game is written in TypeScript, because there is no way I would touch plain JavaScript any longer.

## Compiling

The following tools are required:
- Typescript compiler
- Git LFS (to access the asset files)
  
That's all.


To compile, run `tsc` on root. That's it. Running `make dist` will create a zip package for you. I might add Closure compiler support one day. 


To run the game locally, you need to start a local server. If you have `make` and `python3` installed, you can just run `make server`, or if you have only `python3`, then `python3 -m http.server` will do the same trick. You can also use any other http server of your choice. Then type `localhost:8000` (or whatever port you choose) to the browser.


Note that Git LFS (https://git-lfs.com/) is mandatory since the binary files (graphics and audio files) are stored using it.

## Code style

When starting the project I had this funny idea that all the variables should be declared in the main function body, not inside control blocks. In the middle of the project I asked myself, "Why?", but couldn't figure out an answer. However, it was already too late (not really, but let's pretend it was) to change the coding style at that point.

There are also some other oddities I have forgotten. And a lot of "TODO"s I decided not-to-do.

## License

- The source code, which includes all the `.ts`,`.html` and `makefile` files, is licensed under (*throws a die*) MIT license.
- The music files, which contains all `.ogg` files **excluding `item.ogg`** are licensed under CC-BY-NC-4.0. Use of these asset files should be attributed to H0dari
- All the other asset files not contained in the previous item (that is, all art, level and sound effect files) are licensed under CC-BY-NC-4.0, and should be attributed to Jani Nyk√§nen.

In short: you can do almost everything with the code, even use it for commercial purposes without having to give a credit, but **the asset files cannot be used for commercial purposes and givin a credit is mandatory if the work is derived**.
